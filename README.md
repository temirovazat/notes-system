## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) - Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) - Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language.
* [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/) - Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
* [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) - Yarn is a package manager that doubles down as project manager. Whether you work on one-shot projects or large monorepos, as a hobbyist or an enterprise user, we've got you covered.
